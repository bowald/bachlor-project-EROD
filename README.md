##Abstract
This bachelor thesis details the various graphical effects used when implementing a multiplayer racing game. The aim was to implement suitable graphical effects for a large scale environment and high-speed racing game, with regard to the limited timeframe and resources of the project. The game should also contain enough gameplay to be deemed playable and support multiplayer. Each graphical effect implemented was evaluated and discussed based on its suitability and the final results. The effects implemented, and their corresponding techniques, list names such as deferred shading, shadow mapping, screen space ambient occlusion, bloom, volumetric lighting and particle systems. The other aspects of the game, such as content and gameplay, are somewhat lacking due to the high focus on graphics. We do however consider the final results to be of relatively high visual quality when the various constraints of the project are taken into account.

###This project has no intent of commercial use.
